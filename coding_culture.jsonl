{"question_id": 99, "text": "Summarize the article you have been given in a brief manner.\nInput: Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.", "task": "Self-instruct", "answer": "This article discusses the relationship between mathematics and art, with a focus on visual arts.

It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.\n- Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration\nLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns.

{"question_id": 182, "text": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\nInput: Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "task": "Self-instruct", "answer": "This paper introduces FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding, and guides slot with explicit intent information and proposes a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing.", "domain_review": "Culture", "domain_labeled": ["Culture"], "total_tokens_step2": 765, "metric_explanation": "4: The response should accurately extract the main points from the abstract without any misinformation. \n5: The response should be concise, summarizing the paper's key findings with only the necessary information.\n12: The response should be well-organized and coherent, making it easy for the reader to understand the summary.\n\n[4, 5, 12]", "num_skills": 3, "metrics": ["Factuality", "Conciseness", "Readability"], "total_tokens": 994, "difficulty_review": "Expert level knowledge", "difficulty_labeled": "expert level knowledge"}

{"question_id": 331, "text": "What are the main differences between Python and JavaScript programming languages?", "task": "Vicuna", "answer": "Python and JavaScript are both popular high-level programming languages, but they have some key differences:\n\n1. Purpose: Python is a general-purpose programming language widely used in various domains like web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and scientific computing. JavaScript, on the other hand, was initially designed for client-side web programming but has evolved to support server-side programming with the help of platforms like Node.js.\n\n2. Language Design: Python has a clean, readable syntax that emphasizes simplicity and code-readability, which makes it easier to learn for beginners. JavaScript has a more complex and flexible syntax, influenced by languages like C and Java, which can make it more difficult for beginners.\n\n3. Typing: Python is dynamically typed, which means the type of a variable is determined at runtime. JavaScript is also dynamically typed, but with the addition of TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript), it can have optional static typing.\n\n4. Execution Environment: JavaScript is primarily executed within web browsers, though it can also run on servers with Node.js. Python is executed outside of the browser in various environments, including servers, desktop applications, and scientific computing platforms.\n\n5. Libraries and Frameworks: Python is known for its wide range of libraries and frameworks in various domains, such as Django and Flask for web development, NumPy and Pandas for data analysis, and TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning. JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of front-end libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, as well as server-side frameworks like Express.js for Node.js.\n\n6. Performance: In general, JavaScript tends to have faster execution than Python, primarily due to the investments made in optimizing JavaScript engines for web browsers. However, Python can also achieve high performance in specific domains, like scientific computing, using specialized libraries.\n\n7. Concurrency Model: JavaScript uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model based on an event loop and asynchronous callbacks, which makes it suitable for handling high concurrency in web applications. In contrast, Python uses a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that can limit concurrency in multi-core environments. However, Python offers various ways to handle concurrency, such as threads, multiprocessing, asyncio, or third-party libraries like Gevent or Tornado.\n\n8. Community: While both Python and JavaScript have large, active communities, they tend to focus on different areas \u2013 Python is more popular in academia, data science, and AI/ML, while JavaScript is dominant in web development and increasingly popular in server-side programming.\n\nEach language has its own strengths and use cases, so choosing between Python and JavaScript depends on the specific project, personal preference, and the domain in which you primarily work.", "domain_review": "Coding", "domain_labeled": ["Coding"], "total_tokens_step2": 541, "metric_explanation": "4, 5, 7\n\n4: The response should fulfill the requirements of the instruction by providing relevant information on the main differences between Python and JavaScript programming languages, including their purposes, designs, and other factors differentiating them.\n5: The response should be structured to promote readability and coherence, organizing the differences into easily digestible sections or bullet points for the reader.\n7: The response should provide a comprehensive and thorough explanation, covering a range of key differences between the two languages and explaining each difference in detail.\n\n[4, 5, 7]", "num_skills": 3, "metrics": ["Comprehension", "Readability", "Completeness"], "total_tokens": 1242, "difficulty_review": "Major level knowledge", "difficulty_labeled": "major level knowledge"}
{"question_id": 342, "text": "How do language and cultural barriers affect the way people communicate and form relationships in multicultural societies?", "task": "Vicuna", "answer": "Language and cultural barriers can significantly impact the way people communicate and form relationships in multicultural societies. These barriers can lead to misunderstandings, create tensions, and hinder the development of strong, lasting relationships between individuals from different cultural backgrounds. Some of the specific ways these barriers affect communication and relationships are listed below.\n\n1. Misunderstandings: Language barriers can lead to confusion or misinterpretation of words, phrases, and messages between people from different cultural backgrounds. This can cause frustration or even conflict when attempting to carry out basic conversations or convey important information.\n\n2. Limited communication: Language barriers can limit the depth of communication between individuals, as people with limited language skills in a foreign language may not be able to express their thoughts and feelings or fully understand the thoughts and feelings of others. This can prevent the development of strong emotional connections that are crucial for successful relationships.\n\n3. Reduced trust: Cultural barriers, particularly when unacknowledged or ignored, can create a sense of distrust between individuals from different backgrounds. This distrust can inhibit the formation of meaningful, long-lasting connections and potentially contribute to feelings of isolation.\n\n4. Stereotyping and prejudice: Cultural barriers can also lead to the formation of stereotypes and cultural biases, which can impact how individuals perceive and interact with each other. These stereotypes and prejudices may limit a person's willingness to form close relationships with individuals from different cultural backgrounds.\n\n5. Loss of non-verbal cues: Non-verbal communication, such as body language, gestures, and facial expressions, plays a vital role in conveying messages and emotions. However, these non-verbal cues may differ across cultures, leading to misunder standings and misinterpretations. This can hinder effective communication and create barriers to forming strong relationships.\n\n6. Social isolation: Language and cultural barriers can lead to feelings of social isolation, particularly for immigrants or minority groups, who may struggle to integrate into the broader community. This isolation can prevent people from forming meaningful connections and contribute to negative mental health outcomes.\n\nOverall, language and cultural barriers can impact communication and relationships in multicultural societies significantly.

{"question_id": 346, "text": "How do social media platforms influence the way people consume and share news, and what are the potential implications for the spread of misinformation?", "task": "Vicuna", "answer": "Social media platforms have significantly transformed the way people consume and share news. They have made it easier for users to access, share, and engage with news content, but they also have a few potential implications for the spread of misinformation. Here are some ways that social media platforms influence news consumption and the potential consequences:\n\n1. Speed and accessibility: Social media platforms make it easy for users to access news content quickly and from various sources, which can lead to faster dissemination of information. However, this speed can also allow false news and rumors to spread rapidly before they can be verified or debunked.\n\n2. Echo chambers and filter bubbles: Social media algorithms often work to present users with content that aligns with their interests and beliefs to encourage engagement. Consequently, users may be exposed to a narrow range of news sources and perspectives, forming echo chambers or filter bubbles. This can contribute to the spread of misinformation as users are less likely to question the validity of information that reinforces existing views.\n\n3. User-generated content: Social media platforms allow users to create and share content, offering alternative sources of news and information. However, this also makes it easier for misleading or false information to be produced and spread, contributing to misinformation.\n\n4. Virality and sensationalism: In the pursuit of likes, shares, and attention, social media users may create or share content that is more sensational or provocative. Consequently, this can lead to the prioritization of attention-grabbing headlines and misleading stories rather than accurate, well-researched journalism.\n\n5. Emotional appeal: Posts that evoke strong emotions, such as fear or anger, are more likely to be shared and engaged with on social media. Misinformation can capitalize on these emotions and manipulate users into sharing false or misleading stories.\n\n6. Reduced trust in traditional news sources: As social media platforms become dominant players in the news landscape, users may become increasingly skeptical of traditional news outlets, which could result in a greater reliance on and trust in social media sources that are more vulnerable to misinformation.\n\n7. Fact-checking challenges: With the sheer volume of information circulated on social media, the responsibility of fact-checking becomes difficult for both users and professional fact-checkers. Additionally, the rapid and continuous spread of information on social media makes debunking misinformation an ongoing challenge.\n\nThe above-mentioned aspects indicate that while social media platforms have made it more convenient to access and share news, they also facilitate the spread of misinformation.

Since it's not feasible for me to provide every single detail and code snippet, I'll outline the main steps you need to follow. If you encounter something specific you need assistance with, feel free to ask!\n\n1. Learn about the AMD64 architecture: Begin with understanding the core concepts of the x86-64 (also known as AMD64) architecture, such as memory management, CPU operation, and instruction sets. Useful resources include the AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual.\n\n2. Choose a development environment: Set up a development environment with an appropriate assembler, compiler, and linker for AMD64 systems. Consider using NASM (Netwide Assembler) for assembly language, GCC for C/C++, and LD for linking.\n\n3. Write a bootloader: A bootloader is the very first code that runs when the computer starts. It is responsible for loading your operating system kernel into memory. You'll need to write and assemble the bootloader in x86 assembly language. Save your bootloader code in a file named \"boot.asm\".\n\n4. Write the kernel: This is the core part of your operating system, which manages system resources and provides essential functionality. Write the kernel in C/C++ and start by setting up basic functionality such as printing text to the screen and handling CPU interrupts. Save your kernel code in a file named \"kernel.c\".\n\n5. Configure the build process: Write a Makefile or other build automation tool script to compile and link your bootloader and kernel code. You'll need to ensure that the boot.asm and kernel.c files are compiled correctly, and the resulting binary is created in a suitable format, such as an ELF executable or a flat binary. \n\n6. Create a bootable disk image: Create a bootable disk image (e.g. ISO) containing your compiled bootloader and kernel binary. You can use tools like 'dd' in Linux or 'mkisofs' in Windows to create a bootable disk image.\n\n7. Test and debug: Test your operating system by running it in an emulator or a virtual machine like QEMU, Bochs, or VirtualBox. Debug errors and refine your code based on your findings.\n\n8. Develop essential OS components: Develop essential components such as device drivers, filesystem support, process and task management, memory allocation, input/output (I/O), and inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.\n\n9. Implement a user interface: Add a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) to enable users to interact with your operating system effectively.\n\n10. Plan and execute further development: Once you have a basic system running, continue to expand functionality and improve performance. Engage with the open-source community, gather feedback, and use it to drive your development roadmap.\n\nRemember that this is a high-level overview of the process.

Here are some key ways in which it has changed our habits and preferences:\n\n1. Accessibility: Social media has made news and information easily accessible to anyone with a smartphone or an internet connection. This has increased the number of people who regularly consume news and enables instant access to updates and breaking news stories.\n\n2. Speed: News breaks and spreads much faster on social media, often reaching audiences before traditional news sources. As a result, people are more likely to get real-time updates and stay informed about developing stories.\n\n3. Customization: Social media platforms allow users to follow specific topics, areas of interest, and sources they trust. This personalization of newsfeeds provides users with a curated selection of information that aligns with their preferences.\n\n4. User-generated content: Social media enables ordinary people to act as journalists and cover events in real-time, sometimes even faster than traditional news outlets. This has led to an increase in citizen journalism and the democratization of news reporting.\n\n5. Two-way communication: Social media allows users to engage with news stories by commenting, liking, and sharing content. This interaction fosters public discourse and creates a sense of community around current events while also providing feedback for news publishers.\n\n6. Clickbait and sensationalism: In order to attract the attention of social media users, some publishers resort to clickbait headlines and biased reporting. This can lead to the proliferation of misinformation and a decline in the quality of news reporting.\n\n7. Echo chambers and filter bubbles: Due to the customization of social media platforms, users often find themselves in echo chambers, where they are only exposed to content and opinions that align with their own. This can further polarization and make it difficult for users to access diverse perspectives.\n\n8. Decline in traditional media: The shift to social media as a primary source of news has led to a decline in revenue for traditional media outlets. This has resulted in cost-cutting measures, such as downsizing newsrooms and reducing investigative reporting.\n\nIn conclusion, social media has both positive and negative impacts on the way we consume news and information.

Adopt Incremental Development: Break large projects into smaller iterations or sprints, typically lasting between one and four weeks. This allows for faster feedback, quicker adaptation, and continuous improvement, thus reducing development time.\n\n3. Establish Cross-functional Teams: Agile development relies on collaborative and self-organizing teams that include developers, product owners, and stakeholders. Cross-functional teams help to break down silos, share knowledge, and encourage constant communication for faster decision making and better quality software.\n\n4. Encourage Collaboration and Communication: Foster a working environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas, challenges, and concerns. Use communication tools, daily stand-ups, and regular team meetings to ensure everyone is aligned and engaged.\n\n5. Prioritize Customer Needs: Focus on delivering features that have the highest business value and customer impact by using techniques like prioritized backlogs or MoSCoW prioritization (Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have).\n\n6. Test-Driven Development (TDD): Write tests before writing the actual code, ensuring that all possible scenarios are considered. TDD encourages high-quality code, reduces the chance of defects, and makes the development process more efficient.\n\n7. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Integrate and deploy code changes as soon as they are developed into a shared repository. This allows for quicker identification of defects, reduces manual testing efforts, and accelerates the development process.\n\n8. Emphasize on Working Software: Focus on delivering functional software that meets the user's needs and is potentially shippable at the end of each iteration, rather than focusing solely on documentation and processes.\n\n9. Measure Progress: Use agile metrics and KPIs like velocity, burn-down charts, and cycle time to assess the team's progress, identify areas of improvement, and adapt accordingly.\n\n10. Retrospectives and Continuous Improvement: After each iteration or sprint, hold a retrospective meeting to discuss the achievements, challenges, and areas for improvement.

{"question_id": 455, "text": "Write a persuasive essay arguing for or against the use of social media. What are some of the benefits and drawbacks of social media? How does it affect our relationships, our mental health, and our society as a whole? What are some potential solutions to the problems associated with social media?", "task": "Wizardlm", "answer": "Title: The Double-Edged Sword of Social Media\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs technology continues to advance, social media has rapidly become an integral part of our lives. It has altered the way we communicate, receive information, and perceive the world. But is the widespread use of social media beneficial or detrimental to our lives? On one hand, it offers a plethora of advantages and opportunities, while on the other, it often negatively impacts our mental health, relationships, and society as a whole. This essay will explore both sides of the argument and suggest possible solutions to address social media\u2019s adverse effects.\n\nBenefits of Social Media\n\nSocial media platforms have connected people from across the globe, transcending geographic boundaries and cultural divides. The ease of communication allows us to maintain long-distance friendships, forge professional networks, and participate in virtual communities based on our shared interests. The global stage provided by social media also fosters creativity, with millions of users showcasing their talents and achievements in areas such as art, music, entrepreneurship, and innovation.\n\nMoreover, social media democratizes access to information, offering a platform for citizen journalism and real-time updates on current events. Mainstream media can no longer conceal or manipulate the flow of information as citizens now have a direct line to share their experiences and perspectives. As a result, ordinary people can engage in political discourse and ensure their voices are heard.\n\nDrawbacks of Social Media\n\nDespite its considerable merits, social media also brings several adverse consequences. Cyberbullying has become a significant concern, with the anonymous nature of many online platforms giving rise to an environment where harmful and derogatory remarks can be directed towards others with apparent impunity. The consequences of such behavior can be severe, often leading to negative mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and, in extreme cases, suicide.\n\nAn additional concern is the impact of social media on our attention spans. The constant flood of information and the reward mechanism of \"likes\" and \"shares\" have contributed to a society that craves instant gratification and struggles to focus on activities requiring deep concentration. Furthermore, the time spent browsing social media often detracts from our real-life relationships, leading to social isolation and disconnection.\n\nAnother critical problem associated with social media is the spread of fake news and misinformation. A lack of regulation on these platforms enables anyone to share unreliable content, which can result in public hysteria and even threats to public safety.\n\nPotential Solutions\n\nIn response to these pressing issues, a combination of governance, self-regulation, and education is needed. Governments should consider implementing guidelines and regulations to hold social media companies accountable for the content published on their platforms. Measures could include: requiring the removal of harmful material, combating the spread of fake news, and promoting transparency in advertising practices.\n\nOn an individual level, users must take responsibility for their actions and consumption habits on social media. This includes adhering to proper online etiquette, critically examining information before sharing it, and balancing screen time with other essential activities.\n\nFinally, promoting media literacy and critical thinking at an early age can help prepare future generations to identify unreliable information and reduce vulnerability to manipulation on social media platforms. Additionally, incorporating mental health education can equip individuals with necessary coping strategies and potentially reduce the risk of cyberbullying-related harm.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, social media is both a blessing and a curse. While it has fostered global connections and helped democratize access to information, it has also given rise to a myriad of problems, including cyberbullying, reduced attention spans, strained relationships, and the dissemination of fake news. To manage these issues and maximize social media's benefits, robust strategies embracing government regulation, individual responsibility, and education must be implemented.

Give  code examples  explain how they differ in terms of syntax, semantics, and design principles.", "task": "Wizardlm", "answer": "Object-oriented programming (OOP) and procedural programming are two programming paradigms that define different ways of organizing and structuring code. \n\nObject-Oriented Programming:\n\nOOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data in the form of attributes (also known as properties or fields) and code in the form of methods (functions within the object). Objects can be instances of classes, which are blueprints for creating objects with specific attributes and methods.\n\nMain Features and Characteristics of OOP:\n\n1. Encapsulation: The combining of data and code into a single unit called an object.\n2. Inheritance: Allows one class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class, enabling code reuse and modularity.\n3. Polymorphism: Enables a single interface (function or method name) to represent different behaviors in different classes or objects.\n4. Abstraction: Simplifies complex systems by modeling them at a higher level of representation (i.e., using classes and objects instead of low-level code).\n\nProcedural Programming:\n\nProcedural programming is a programming paradigm based on procedures or routines, which are a series of steps to be carried out in sequence. In procedural programming, code is organized in functions or procedures that perform a specific task. The program's flow is primarily achieved through function calls, loops, and control structures.\n\nMain Features and Characteristics of Procedural Programming:\n\n1. Sequential execution: Code is executed in the order it appears.\n2. Modularity: Code is organized into functions or procedures.\n3. Limited scope: Variables have limited scope, reducing the chances of unintended interactions between code segments.\n4. Clear and simple control structures: Uses loops and conditional statements to control the flow of execution.\n\nCode Examples:\n\nHere is a simple example in Python that demonstrates the differences in syntax, semantics, and design principles between OOP and procedural programming.\n\nObject-Oriented Programming:\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\n    def bark(self):\n        return f\"{self.name} barks!\"\n\n    def have_birthday(self):\n        self.age += 1\n\ndog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", 2)\nprint(dog1.bark())  # \"Buddy barks!\"\ndog1.have_birthday()\nprint(dog1.age)  # 3\n```\n\nProcedural Programming:\n\n```python\ndef bark(name):\n    return f\"{name} barks!\"\n\ndef have_birthday(age):\n    return age + 1\n\ndog_name = \"Buddy\"\ndog_age = 2\nprint(bark(dog_name))  # \"Buddy barks!\"\ndog_age = have_birthday(dog_age)\nprint(dog_age)  # 3\n```\n\nIn the OOP example, the Dog class represents the blueprint for creating Dog objects, which have attributes (name and age) and methods (bark and have_birthday). The procedural example, on the other hand, has separate functions for performing tasks, and data is passed explicitly between functions.\n\nIn OOP, the focus is on objects and their interactions, whereas procedural programming emphasizes algorithms and the flow of data between functions.

The main operations on a stack are push and pop. Push adds an element to the top of the stack, while pop removes the top element.\n3. There is support for a method called peek() or top() that returns the top element without removing it from the stack.\n4. Checking if the stack is empty is another basic operation performed on a stack.\n5. In some cases, there can be a size limitation for the stack, while in other cases, it can dynamically resize.\n\nQueue:\n1. A queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, which means that the first element added to the queue is the first to be removed.\n2. The main operations on a queue are enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue adds an element to the rear of the queue, while dequeue removes the front element from the queue.\n3. The method to get the front element without removing it is called peek() or front().\n4.

Stack:\nA stack follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle, meaning the most recently added element will be removed first. You can visualize a stack like a stack of plates, where you add plates on top and remove them from the top as well.\n\nOperations:\n- Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.\n- Pop: Remove and return the top element from the stack.\n\nExample: Imagine a stack of books. When you add a book, you place it on top of the stack, and when you want to remove a book, you take it off the top. In this example, the push operation would be adding a book, and the pop operation would be removing the top book.\n\nUsage in Computer Science:\n- Managing function calls: The call stack stores information about the active subroutines in a program.\n- Parsing expressions and syntax: Stacks can be used in compilers for tasks such as parsing arithmetic expressions and maintaining proper nesting of parentheses.\n- Backtracking: Stacks can help to maintain backtracking algorithms for problems like searching for a path in a maze or solving puzzles.\n\n2. Queue:\nA queue follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle, meaning the element that was added first will be removed first. You can visualize a queue like a line of people waiting for a bus, where people join at the back of the line and leave from the front.\n\nOperations:\n- Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.\n- Dequeue: Remove and return the element from the front of the queue.\n\nExample: A print queue is an example of a queue in action. When you send documents to a printer, they join the queue in the order they were sent. As each document is printed, it is dequeued from the front of the queue, and the other documents move forward.\n\nUsage in Computer Science:\n- Buffering: Queues can be used to manage tasks, such as buffering data between two processes that have different execution speeds.\n- Synchronization: They can be utilized to synchronize events or tasks occurring at different times or having different computing resource requirements.\n- Job scheduling: Queues are used in task scheduling algorithms (e.g., CPUs managing multiple process threads).\n- Graph traversal: In algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse graphs, queues are used to maintain the processing order of nodes.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between a stack and a queue is in how elements are added and removed.

Linking: The compiler links the machine code with any required libraries or external functions.\n\nAdvantages of a compiler:\n- Faster execution, as the translation happens once, before runtime.\n- More optimizations are possible, leading to better performance.\n- Compiler-generated errors can be fixed before runtime, reducing the risk of runtime errors.\n- The compiled executable is often more secure and harder to reverse-engineer.\n\nDisadvantages of a compiler:\n- Slower development, as the code needs to be compiled before it can be run.\n- Can require more hardware resources during the compilation process.\n- The compiled code may not be easily portable between different platforms.\n\nAn interpreter, on the other hand, translates a high-level programming language into machine language on-the-fly during program execution. The source code is read and executed line by line, with translation happening concurrently. Python, Ruby, and JavaScript are examples of interpreted languages.\n\nThe process of using an interpreter involves:\n1. Lexical analysis: The source code is converted into a sequence of tokens.\n2. Syntax analysis: The token sequence is parsed and checked for grammatical correctness.\n3. Semantic analysis: The interpreter builds an abstract syntax tree and checks for semantic correctness.\n4. Execution: The interpreter executes the statements directly, one at a time.\n\nAdvantages of an interpreter:\n- Faster development, as the code runs directly without compilation.\n- Simplifies program updates, as changes can be made directly in the source code.\n- Code is often more portable between different platforms, as it's executed in a platform-specific interpreter.\n- Utilizes fewer resources during translation.\n\nDisadvantages of an interpreter:\n- Slower execution, as translation occurs during runtime.\n- Limited optimization capabilities compared to a compiler.\n- The source code might be less secure and can be easily reverse-engineered.\n- Generally higher risk of runtime errors, as errors are discovered during execution.\n\nIn summary, a compiler is more suitable for performance-critical programs and applications that require fast execution, while an interpreter is better for rapid development and for scripting languages where ease of updating and platform portability are more important.", "domain_review": "Coding", "domain_labeled": ["Coding"], "total_tokens_step2": 596, "metric_explanation": "5, 3, 10\n\nSkill 5: Provide a comprehensive explanation by detailing the differences between a compiler and an interpreter, their working mechanism, advantages, disadvantages, and examples of programming languages that use these tools.\nSkill 3: Retrieve accurate background knowledge to precisely explain the differences and functioning of compilers and interpreters, as well as to provide relevant examples of programming languages.\nSkill 10: Fulfill the complex requirements of the instruction by covering the differences, advantages, disadvantages, and examples of programming languages that use compilers and interpreters.\n\n[5, 3, 10]", "num_skills": 3, "metrics": ["Completeness", "Factuality", "Comprehension"], "total_tokens": 1400, "difficulty_review": "Major level knowledge", "difficulty_labeled": "major level knowledge"}

{"question_id": 471, "text": "Define object-oriented programming and procedural programming and describe their main features and characteristics. Give  code examples  explain how they differ in terms of syntax, semantics, and design principles. ", "task": "Wizardlm", "answer": "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Procedural Programming are two programming paradigms that dictate how a program is organized and how solutions to problems are implemented. Let's dive into each paradigm's definition, main features and characteristics, and provide examples to illustrate their differences.\n\nObject-Oriented Programming (OOP):\nDefinition: OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\" which represent data structures and contain data in the form of fields (attributes) and code in the form of procedures (methods).\n\nMain features and characteristics:\n1. Encapsulation: Objects contain both data and behavior, making it easy to manage and organize code.\n2. Inheritance: Classes can inherit attributes and behaviors from other classes, which promotes code reuse and modularity.\n3. Polymorphism: Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling more flexible and extensible code.\n4. Abstraction: Complex systems can be modeled by breaking them down into simpler, more manageable components (objects and classes).\n\nExample code (in Python):\n```python\nclass Animal:\n    def speak(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def speak(self):\n        return \"Woof!\"\n\nclass Cat(Animal):\n    def speak(self):\n        return \"Meow!\"\n\nanimals = [Dog(), Cat()]\nfor animal in animals:\n    print(animal.speak())\n```\n\nProcedural Programming:\nDefinition: Procedural Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of procedures (or subroutines) that perform specific tasks, operating on data passed as arguments and potentially altering the program's state.\n\nMain features and characteristics:\n1. Linear progression: Code execution follows a step-by-step sequential order.\n2. Modularity: Programs are organized into procedures, making it easier to manage and maintain code.\n3. Local variables: Variables have limited scope and lifespan, which reduces unintended side effects.\n4. Separation of data and behavior: Data and the code that manipulates it are usually kept separate (unlike OOP).\n\nExample code (in C):\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid speak_dog() {\n    printf(\"Woof!\\n\");\n}\n\nvoid speak_cat() {\n    printf(\"Meow!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main() {\n    speak_dog();\n    speak_cat();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nDifferences in syntax, semantics, and design principles:\n1. Syntax: OOP languages typically use classes and objects, while procedural languages use functions and structured data.\n2. Semantics: In OOP, attributes and behaviors are bundled together in objects, while procedural programming keeps them separate.\n3. Design principles: OOP encourages modeling real-world entities as objects with attributes and behaviors, while procedural programming emphasizes breaking down tasks into sequences of procedures.\n\nIn summary, OOP and Procedural Programming have distinct approaches to organizing code and solving problems. OOP focuses on encapsulating data and functionality in objects, enabling code reuse and modularity through inheritance and polymorphism. Procedural Programming, on the other hand, emphasizes breaking down tasks into procedures and organizing code execution in a linear fashion.", "domain_review": "Coding", "domain_labeled": ["Coding"], "total_tokens_step2": 565, "metric_explanation": "3, 7, 12\n\n3: The response should provide accurate and detailed information about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Procedural Programming, ensuring the definitions, main features, characteristics, and examples are factual and reliable.\n\n7: The response must cover the aspects of defining both paradigms, highlighting their main features and characteristics, offering code examples, and discussing the differences in syntax, semantics, and design principles.\n\n12: The response should be well-organized and structured to effectively communicate the concepts and differences between Object-Oriented and Procedural Programming to the reader.\n\n[3, 7, 12]", "num_skills": 3, "metrics": ["Factuality", "Comprehension", "Readability"], "total_tokens": 1377, "difficulty_review": "Major level knowledge", "difficulty_labeled": "major level knowledge"}

Here's a thorough analysis of different virtualization models:\n\n1. Full Virtualization:\nIn full virtualization, an entire operating system runs on top of a physical host, with complete isolation from the underlying host system and other virtualized environments. The primary full virtualization technologies in Linux are KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) and Xen.\n\na. KVM:\n- Architectural Design: KVM extends the Linux kernel to work as a Type-2 hypervisor, supporting multiple fully-virtualized guest systems.\n- Resource Isolation: KVM provides strong isolation between virtual machines (VMs) through process and namespace isolation.\n- Scalability: Scale is achieved by adding more VMs, but with limited performance compared to containers due to the overhead associated with running independent OS instances.\n- Management: KVM can be managed using the QEMU command-line interface or GUI tools like virt-manager. It also integrates with cloud management platforms like OpenStack and oVirt.\n\nb. Xen:\n- Architectural Design: Xen is a Type-1 hypervisor, running directly on hardware and managing access to resources for guest VMs.\n- Resource Isolation: Similar to KVM, Xen enforces strong isolation between VMs, providing a secure environment.\n- Scalability: Although Xen allows scaling by adding more VMs, performance limitations arise due to the overhead of running multiple independent OS instances.\n- Management: Xen features tools like the Xen Management API (XAPI) and Xen Orchestra for management. It also supports integration with cloud management platforms like OpenStack.\n\n2. Containerization:\nContainerization platforms like Docker and Kubernetes package application code with its dependencies, running them as isolated and lightweight containers on the same OS kernel.\n\na. Docker:\n- Architectural Design: Docker uses Linux kernel features like cgroups, namespaces, and overlay filesystems to provide an isolated environment for each container.\n- Resource Isolation: It enforces resource isolation using cgroups and kernel namespaces, albeit with weaker isolation compared to full virtualization.\n- Scalability: Docker easily scales horizontally by adding more containers, often with better performance due to a lower overhead of running containers on the same OS kernel.\n- Management: Docker's command-line interface (CLI) and RESTful API manage containers, while tools like Docker Compose and Docker Swarm help with orchestrating multi-container configurations.\n\nb. Kubernetes:\n- Architectural Design: Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that manages the deployment, scaling, and maintenance of containerized applications on multiple hosts.\n- Resource Isolation: Kubernetes inherits the isolation provided by container runtime (e.g., Docker) and adds namespace isolation for resources like configMaps, services, and deployments.\n- Scalability: Kubernetes helps achieve horizontal scaling by automatically distributing container replicas across nodes based on resource requirements.\n- Management: Kubernetes relies on kubectl command-line and RESTful API for managing resources, while additional tools like Helm aid in managing application deployments.\n\nUse Cases:\n\n1. Cloud Computing: Full virtualization technologies such as KVM and Xen are better suited for providing securely isolated environments required in cloud computing. However, containers offer faster provisioning and better resource utilization, making them increasingly popular in hybrid cloud and multi-cloud scenarios.\n\n2. DevOps: Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes proves highly beneficial in DevOps for CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and application deployment due to their lightweight nature, fast startup times, and ease of management.\n\n3. Software Development: Containerization is advantageous in software development scenarios as it simplifies dependency management and allows better collaboration among developers on different platforms.\n\nOverall, the choice between full virtualization and containerization depends on specific requirements, including performance, security, scalability, and management preferences.", "domain_review": "Technology, Coding", "domain_labeled": ["Technology", "Coding"], "total_tokens_step2": 559, "metric_explanation": "2, 5, 10\n\n2: The response should provide a comprehensive explanation of different virtualization models, their features, and use cases with sufficient detail and thorough analysis.\n\n5: The model needs to accurately interpret the different virtualization technologies and their characteristics to provide correct information about their architecture, resource isolation, scalability, and management features.\n\n10: The response must fulfill the instruction by discussing various aspects of the virtualization models, evaluating benefits and challenges, and considering different use cases like cloud computing, DevOps, and software development.\n\n[2, 5, 10]", "num_skills": 3, "metrics": ["Completeness", "Commonsense Understanding", "Comprehension"], "total_tokens": 1552, "difficulty_review": "Expert level knowledge", "difficulty_labeled": "expert level knowledge"}

Here's an outline of the process:\n\n1. Collect an initial dataset: Begin by collecting a diverse dataset that contains examples of conversations or tasks your assistant needs to perform. This dataset can be created from scratch or you can use existing datasets, like the InstructGPT dataset from OpenAI or other language-modeling corpora.\n\n2. Fine-tune the model: Use supervised fine-tuning to adapt a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-3) to your dataset. This step involves training the model on your dataset to better understand the context and generate more accurate responses or instructions.\n\n3. Collect human feedback: Gather a set of human AI trainers who will generate conversations or tasks and provide an evaluation of the model's performance. AI trainers can evaluate multiple model-generated responses and rank them according to quality. This will create a dataset with human feedback that can be used for reinforcement learning.\n\n4. Train a reward model: Create a reward model that can predict the quality of the model's output based on the human feedback data. This reward model will be used to guide the reinforcement learning algorithm on improving the language model's performance.\n\n5. Implement RL with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): Reinforce your fine-tuned model using a reinforcement learning algorithm, such as PPO. Using the previously trained reward model as a signal, PPO will iteratively update and improve the model's policy to produce better responses or instructions.\n\n6. Perform iterative fine-tuning and RL iterations: It's essential to iterate between fine-tuning, collecting human feedback, reward modeling, and reinforcement learning to achieve continuous improvement in performance, accuracy, and utility. This process should be repeated several times to gradually improve the quality of your human-like assistant.\n\n7. Evaluate and benchmark your assistant: Measure the quality of your language model by using external evaluators or metrics, such as the Mean Rank or the Mean Average Precision (MAP) score. Compare the performance of your assistant with that of other open-source assistants or baselines to verify whether it has truly exceeded their performance.\n\n8.

The prefetcher can recognize linear and some non-linear access patterns in unsorted data, reducing cache misses.\n\n4.

They work on the principle of both spatial and temporal locality:\n\n1. Temporal locality: If we access a memory location, it is likely that we will access the same location again soon.\n2. Spatial locality: If we access a memory location, it is likely that we will access nearby memory locations soon.\n\nCache lines are responsible for fetching data from the main memory into the cache. When a CPU accesses a memory location, it fetches the entire cache line containing the requested data into the cache. The idea is that nearby memory locations are likely to be accessed soon, which will be faster if they are already in the cache.\n\nIn your code example, sorting the data makes the values more predictable and consecutive. So, when you access an element in the sorted array, chances are high that nearby elements are already loaded in the cache line or will be accessed soon, which results in better spatial locality. Therefore, processing a sorted array is faster because it takes better advantage of the cache locality, reducing cache misses and improving overall performance.\n\nIn contrast, an unsorted array has a more unpredictable access pattern, causing more cache misses since the data is spread out randomly, and the CPU has to fetch data from the main memory more frequently.\n\nIn summary, cache locality is the key factor underlying the observed performance difference.

This answer is purely speculative, as there's no definitive evidence to suggest that such contact has occurred. The impacts can be analyzed in several aspects:\n\n1. Communication and Cooperation: The initial challenge would likely be communication, as our languages and modes of communication could widely differ from theirs. However, assuming both species were able to develop a mutually understandable language or system of communication, this could facilitate the exchange of knowledge and technology. Joint efforts in scientific exploration, space travel, and resource sharing might emerge as a result of such cooperation.\n\n2. Science and Technology: Alien contact would undeniably impact our understanding of science and technology. By sharing their advancements and discoveries, our progress in fields such as astronomy, biology, chemistry, and physics could be vastly accelerated. This newfound knowledge might also give rise to advancements in healthcare, transportation, energy production, and other essential sectors.\n\n3. Religion and Philosophy: The existence of aliens would cause a reevaluation of our current religious beliefs and philosophical ideas. People might question humanity's uniqueness and the concept of God. New religious and philosophical thoughts could emerge in an attempt to reconcile these new ideas, leading to the evolution or reinterpretation of existing religious beliefs.\n\n4. Art: With the exchange of culture between humans and aliens, we could expect a significant influence on art, literature, music, and other creative fields. Alien aesthetics, concepts, and symbols could be incorporated into our own artistic expression, resulting in new genres and styles. This fusion of ideas could stimulate a renaissance in artistic creativity.\n\n5. Social and Political Development: The interaction with an alien civilization could encourage humanity to unite for common goals instead of fighting against each other. Confronted with evidence of an advanced society, humans might place greater emphasis on global collaboration and abandon existing systems that perpetuate conflict and division. This paradigm shift could lead to a more harmonious global community.\n\nIn summary, alien contact in the past could have had profound effects on human civilization and culture.

{"question_id": 568, "text": "What are the differences between the rules of American football and rugby? How do these differences affect the way the games are played? Which sport do you think is more physically demanding and why? Please provide examples to support your answer.", "task": "Wizardlm", "answer": "American football and rugby are both contact sports that involve running with an oblong ball and scoring by crossing the opposing team's goal line. However, there are significant differences in the rules, structure, and nature of these games, which affect the way they are played.\n\n1. Scoring: In American football, there are four ways to score points: touchdown (6 points), field goal (3 points), extra point conversion (1-2 points, depending on the type of conversion), and safety (2 points). A touchdown is scored by crossing the opponent's goal line with the ball, and field goals are scored by kicking the ball through the goalposts. In rugby, there are two main ways to score points: try (5 points) and conversion (2 points). A try is scored by touching the ball down in the opponent's in-goal area, and a conversion is when the ball is kicked through the goalposts after scoring a try.\n\n2. Passing: In American football, players can pass the ball both forward and laterally during offensive plays. In rugby, forward passing is not allowed. The ball can only be passed laterally or backward to teammates.\n\n3. Tackling: In both sports, players can tackle opponents to stop their progress. However, tackling in rugby tends to be less forceful because players must wrap their arms around the ball carrier's legs or torso rather than hitting or blocking them. In American football, players can use their bodies or hands to bring down the ball carrier, often leading to more aggressive tackles.\n\n4. Play structure: American football is divided into downs or distinct plays, with the team getting four chances (downs) to advance 10 yards. If the team fails to achieve this, they turn over possession to the opposition. Rugby is a much more fluid game with continuous play, and possession can change quickly through turnovers, interceptions, or knock-ons (dropping the ball).\n\n5. Protective equipment: American football players wear helmets, shoulder pads, and other protective gear, whereas rugby players generally only wear mouthguards and minimal padding. This difference affects the style of play, with American football focusing more on high-impact collisions and rugby emphasizing agility and evasion.\n\n6. Set pieces: Rugby has scrums and lineouts that serve as restarts after certain infractions occur or the ball goes out of bounds. American football has no equivalent to these set pieces.\n\nAs for which sport is more physically demanding, both sports require strength, endurance, and agility. However, some might argue that rugby is more demanding due to the continuous play with fewer breaks in comparison to American football's more segmented play structure. Rugby players, on average, run significantly more during a game than American football players and are involved in more aerobic activities.\n\nOn the other hand, the high-impact tackling and collisions in American football also require immense physical strength and durability, which can be seen as more demanding by some. The additional padding and protective gear may also add to the physical burden. Ultimately, it may be subjective as to which sport is more physically demanding, as both games are taxing in their ways.\n\nIn summary, American football and rugby are contact sports with unique rules and structures that affect the way each game is played. Both involve running with and/or kicking an oblong ball and are physically demanding in different ways. The differences in rules, such as the forms of tackling, continuous vs. segmented play, and differences in scoring, make each sport distinct and attractive to different types of athletes and fans.", "domain_review": "Culture, Health", "domain_labeled": ["Culture", "Health"], "total_tokens_step2": 505, "metric_explanation": "2, 8, 12\n\nSkill 2 should be applied to provide relevant information on differences between American football and rugby, how these differences affect gameplay, and which sport is more physically demanding with examples.

How does it affect Hamlet\u2019s character and his actions throughout the play? Please provide evidence from the text to support your answer.", "task": "Wizardlm", "answer": "In William Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet,\" the ghost of Hamlet's father, King Hamlet, plays a significant role in driving the plot and influencing Hamlet's character and actions. The ghost's primary purpose is to provide a catalyst for Hamlet's quest for revenge against his Uncle Claudius, who murdered King Hamlet to seize the throne. The supernatural presence of the ghost also helps to build a sense of suspense and adds to the overall theme of uncertainty and corruption that pervades the play.\n\nThe ghost affects Hamlet's character by triggering profound emotional turmoil and sparking his desire for revenge. When the ghost appears to Hamlet in Act 1, Scene 5, it reveals the truth about King Hamlet's death. The ghost's exact words were:\n\n\"Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.\" (Act 1, Scene 5)\n\nThis disclosure is instrumental in shaping Hamlet's actions and thoughts as he grapples with the reality of his father's murder and the treachery of his uncle. Owing to the ghost's revelation, Hamlet's character evolves from an introspective, grief-stricken prince to an avenger determined to seek justice.\n\nThe ghost's impact on Hamlet's actions throughout the play is evident in various episodes. First, the revelation of his father's murder and the demand for revenge causes Hamlet to feign madness, starting the \"antic disposition\" to hide his true intentions:\n\n\"Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,\nHow strange or odd some'er I bear myself,\nAs I, perchance, hereafter shall think meet\nTo put an antic disposition on\u2014\" (Act 1, Scene 5)\n\nThis strategy, which will have far-reaching consequences, allows him to investigate his father's murder and determine the truth behind the ghost's claims.\n\nAdditionally, Hamlet's interactions with other characters, such as Ophelia, Gertrude, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern, are marked by distrust and miscommunication, reflecting his disillusionment with the world that has resulted from the ghost's revelations. For example, when speaking to Gertrude about his father's death, he says:\n\n\"A bloody deed? almost as bad, good mother,\nAs kill a king, and marry with his brother.\" (Act 3, Scene 4)\n\nIn this way, the ghost of King Hamlet functions as a driving force in the play, setting the stage for the tragic and violent consequences that will unfold.

How does his story relate to the themes of the movie and the other characters\u2019 actions? Please provide evidence from the movie to support your answer.", "task": "Wizardlm", "answer": "In \"The Shawshank Redemption\", the character Brooks Hatlen, played by James Whitmore, is an older inmate who has been incarcerated for most of his life. He serves multiple purposes in the story, acting as a mentor, a cautionary tale, and a symbol of the overarching themes of the movie. His story deeply relates to the themes of institutionalization, the human struggle for meaning and purpose, and the power of hope and redemption.\n\nSignificance of Brooks Hatlen:\n\n1. Institutionalization: Brooks represents the concept of institutionalization, where an individual becomes so accustomed to the structure and routines of an environment (in this case, the prison) that they struggle to function in the outside world. As the prison librarian, Brooks is relatively content within the confines of the Shawshank State Penitentiary. However, after his eventual release on parole, he finds it difficult to adapt to life outside of prison and tragically takes his own life. This aspect of his character is crucial, as it highlights the effect of long-term incarceration on a person's ability to reintegrate into society and emphasizes the importance of hope and purpose in the face of adversity.\n\n2. The human struggle for meaning and purpose: Brooks' eventual suicide serves as a testament to the importance of maintaining a sense of purpose and connection to the world around us. It also contrasts with other characters such as Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) and Red (played by Morgan Freeman), who manage to find their purpose beyond the walls of Shawshank through friendship, determination, and hope.\n\n3. The power of hope and redemption: Brooks' tragic fate serves as a cautionary tale for Andy and Red, demonstrating the importance of maintaining hope and seeking a way out of their circumstances. This is particularly evident in Andy's case, as he dreams of a better life in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, and ultimately succeeds in escaping his wrongful imprisonment. Red's eventual redemption comes in the form of learning from Andy's positive influence and regaining hope, which ultimately allows him to embrace freedom and join Andy in Mexico.\n\nEvidence from the movie:\n\n1. The \"Brooks was here\" scene: Following Brooks' release from prison, he writes a letter to his old friends describing how he cannot adjust to life outside of Shawshank and feels isolated and scared. The culmination of this scene, with Brooks' suicide and the poignant etching of \"Brooks was here\" on the beam from which he hangs himself, is a powerful reminder of the effects of institutionalization.\n\n2. Brooks as a mentor: Throughout his time in Shawshank, Brooks acts as a mentor and friend to other inmates, including Andy and Red. This connection helps to humanize Brooks as a character and also serves as a bond that motivates both Andy and Red to seek their own forms of redemption.\n\n3. Red's narration: Red's narration throughout the story is crucial in highlighting the themes and messages relating to Brooks' character. When Red reflects on Brooks' fate, he explicitly acknowledges the impact of institutionalization and the importance of hope in their lives, stating, \"These walls are funny. First, you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them. That's institutionalized.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the character of Brooks Hatlen in \"The Shawshank Redemption\" serves as a poignant representation of the effects of institutionalization, the human struggle for meaning and purpose, and the power of hope and redemption. His story is intertwined with those of the main characters, Andy and Red, and helps to emphasize the film's overarching themes.", "domain_review": "Culture, History", "domain_labeled": ["Culture", "History"], "total_tokens_step2": 510, "metric_explanation": "2, 5, 8\n\n2: The response should accurately retrieve essential background knowledge about the movie, its themes, and character relationships without any misinformation.\n5: The response must address the significance of the character Brooks Hatlen, how his story relates to the movie's themes, and provide supporting evidence from the movie.\n8: The response should be comprehensive and thorough in its explanation, covering the necessary details of Brooks Hatlen's significance, the themes, and the other characters' interactions.\n\n[2, 5, 8]", "num_skills": 3, "metrics": ["Factuality", "Comprehension", "Completeness"], "total_tokens": 1471, "difficulty_review": "Major level knowledge", "difficulty_labeled": "major level knowledge"}

How do they relate to the themes of the painting and the other elements in the painting? Please provide evidence from the painting to support your answer.", "task": "Wizardlm", "answer": "\"The Persistence of Memory\" by Salvador Dali, painted in 1931, is one of the most famous surrealist works of art. The melting clocks are considered to be a significant symbol in the painting, as they are believed to represent the fluidity and instability of time. \n\nThere are several interpretations of the melting clocks and their relationship with the themes of the painting. One interpretation is that the melting clocks symbolize the subjective nature of time, suggesting that it is not a constant force, but rather something that can be manipulated depending on one's perception or state of mind. This idea is supported by the soft, malleable forms of the clocks, which contrast with conventional images of solid, mechanical timepieces.\n\nAnother interpretation is that the melting clocks reference the influence of Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity on Dali's thought. According to the theory of relativity, time is not absolute but instead is relative, depending on an individual\u2019s position and motion. The clocks, therefore, represent the fluid nature of time in a world governed by Einstein\u2019s ideas.\n\nIn addition to the melting clocks, there are other elements in the painting that support these interpretations. The barren landscape, with its distorted cliffs and smooth, reflective surfaces, evokes a dreamlike quality. This supports the idea that time is malleable and can blend into the subconscious mind's landscape. The distorted and disfigured face in the painting, which is believed to be a self-portrait of Dali, can further reinforce the theme of subjective perception. The face emerges from the landscape as if it is a part of it, suggesting the interconnectedness of the individual's perception of time, memory, and self.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of ants on the clock which seems to be the hardest, suggests the theme of decay and the passage of time. This could symbolize the fleeting nature of existence. Ants are recurrent symbols in Dali\u2019s work and often represent decay and the ephemeral quality of time.\n\nTaking these elements into account, the melting clocks in Dali's \"The Persistence of Memory\" can be seen as a representation of the fluidity of time, the subjective nature of perception, and the influence of modern physics on how we understand the world around us.", "domain_review": "Culture, History", "domain_labeled": ["Culture", "History"], "total_tokens_step2": 512, "metric_explanation": "3, 10, 7\n\nSkill 3: The model needs to extract pertinent and accurate background knowledge about Dali's \"The Persistence of Memory\" and the significance of the melting clocks, as well as provide reliable evidence or citations to support the information provided.\n\nSkill 10: The model should present creative, original, or novel interpretations of the melting clocks, their relation to the painting's themes, and how they connect with other elements in the artwork.\n\nSkill 7: The response should be comprehensive and thorough in discussing the various aspects of the painting, providing sufficient explanations about the melting clocks, themes, and supporting evidence from the painting.\n\n[3, 10, 7]", "num_skills": 3, "metrics": ["Factuality", "Insightfulness", "Completeness"], "total_tokens": 1218, "difficulty_review": "Major level knowledge", "difficulty_labeled": "major level knowledge"}

They achieved this by using vibrant and contrasting colors, loose brushstrokes, and focusing on the overall visual impression rather than detailed realism.\n\nTwo renowned Impressionist painters who were pioneers in the use of color were Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir.\n\nClaude Monet, often considered the father of Impressionism, utilized color to capture the ever-changing effects of light and atmosphere in his paintings. Monet painted the same scene multiple times under various lighting and weather conditions to explore how color could convey different moods. One of his most famous series, the \"Haystacks,\" showcased his mastery of color. Monet employed bright, complementary colors and contrasting tones to create depth and convey the ephemeral quality of light. For instance, he used blues and purples in the shadows to contrast with warm yellows and oranges in the sunlight. This innovative approach to color allowed Monet to create a sense of atmosphere in his works, evoking various emotions based on the lighting conditions depicted.\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir was another prominent Impressionist painter who mastered the use of color in his works. Renoir focused on figurative subjects and often portrayed people in relaxed, informal settings. In his paintings, he emphasized the warm, radiant glow of the human skin by applying delicate, luminous, and transparent colors. He achieved this effect by using free and spontaneous brushstrokes, allowing the viewer to see the individual strokes of color and creating a sense of fluidity and movement. Renoir's use of bright, saturated colors, particularly in the clothing and backgrounds of his paintings, added to the overall sense of warmth, harmony, and vitality that characterizes his work.\n\nIn essence, the Impressionist painters' use of color fundamentally changed art by emphasizing the importance of capturing the visual impression of a scene through contrasts in light and color, rather than focusing on realistic details. Monet and Renoir's innovative color techniques allowed them to infuse their works with distinctive moods, atmospheres, and expressions that continue to captivate and inspire artists and viewers alike.", "domain_review": "Culture, Humanities", "domain_labeled": ["Culture", "Humanities"], "total_tokens_step2": 515, "metric_explanation": "4, 7, 6\n\nSkill 4: When answering this instruction, the response should cover the Impressionist artists' use of color comprehensively, including examples of at least two artists and a detailed explanation of their techniques, and how these techniques influenced the mood, atmosphere, and expression of their paintings.\n\nSkill 7: To fulfill the requirements of this instruction, the response should provide information on Impressionist artists' use of color and its effects, while focusing on at least two artists and describing their application of color in their works.\n\nSkill 6: When discussing the artists' techniques and the impact on their paintings, it is necessary to ensure the extracted background knowledge is accurate by providing reliable sources when needed.\n\n[4, 7, 6]", "num_skills": 3, "metrics": ["Completeness", "Comprehension", "Factuality"], "total_tokens": 1239, "difficulty_review": "Major level knowledge", "difficulty_labeled": "major level knowledge"}

How does it relate to the themes of the painting and the other elements in the painting? Please provide evidence from the painting to support your answer.", "task": "Wizardlm", "answer": "Vincent van Gogh's \"The Starry Night\" is one of the most famous and recognizable paintings in the world, with its swirling sky being the most distinct feature. The swirling sky is often interpreted as a representation of Van Gogh's emotional and mental state during the time he created the painting. It is believed to convey a sense of turmoil, chaos, and even a cosmic force. However, the swirling patterns also have an aspect of beauty and tranquility, suggesting a balance between chaos and harmony.\n\nThe Starry Night was painted during Van Gogh's stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence, France, in 1889. He was seeking treatment for his mental health issues there, and the painting can be seen as a reflection of his emotional turbulence during that period.\n\nSeveral themes can be derived from the swirling sky in relation to other elements in the painting:\n\n1. Connection to Nature: The swirling sky is a powerful representation of the natural world and the forces that govern it. The swirling patterns are reminiscent of the movement of the wind, clouds, and celestial bodies, thus emphasizing the importance of nature in Van Gogh's work.\n\n2. Contrast between Reality and Imagination: The sky is an expression of Van Gogh's imagination rather than just a depiction of the night sky. The exaggerated swirls contrast with more realistic elements in the painting, such as the village below. This contrast allows the viewer to explore the line between the real world and the world of the artist's imagination.\n\n3. Emotional Turmoil: The swirling sky can be seen as a metaphor for Van Gogh's mind and the emotional turmoil he was experiencing during his time at the asylum. The dynamic movement of the sky reflects the artist's inner turmoil and his feelings of restlessness, anxiety, and despair.\n\n4. Hope and Spirituality: Despite the turmoil suggested by the sky, the painting also has elements of hope and spirituality. The shining stars are a symbol of hope and divine guidance amidst darkness and chaos. Additionally, the presence of the Cypress tree, often associated with mourning and eternal life, could symbolize a spiritual connection and a search for meaning in life.\n\nIn conclusion, the swirling sky in \"The Starry Night\" is a significant element because it serves as a visual representation of the artist's emotional and mental state, a connection to nature, and a contrast between reality and imagination. Through this element, Van Gogh was able to convey an array of complex themes, including hope, despair, chaos, and harmony, making the painting a timeless masterpiece.", "domain_review": "Culture, Humanities", "domain_labeled": ["Culture", "Humanities"], "total_tokens_step2": 513, "metric_explanation": "1: This skill is crucial because the instruction requires an analysis of the significance of the swirling sky in \"The Starry Night\" and its relation to the themes and other elements in the painting.

{"question_id": 617, "text": "What were the main causes of World War I and how did it start? Discuss the key events that led to the war and how it impacted the world.", "task": "Wizardlm", "answer": "World War I, also known as the Great War, began on July 28, 1914, and lasted until November 11, 1918. The war was primarily fought between two large alliances: the Triple Entente, comprising of France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, and the Central Powers, consisting of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. The main causes of World War I were a complex mix of factors, including militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism. \n\n1. Militarism: The nations of Europe had been increasing their military power over time, adopting the idea that a strong military was essential for national security and prestige. This arms race created an atmosphere of constant suspicion, tension, and preparedness for war.\n\n2. Alliances: In order to strengthen their security, nations formed alliances promising mutual protection in case of an attack. The formation of these alliances divided Europe into two opposing groups of countries, making conflict among any one pair of nations likely to involve the entire continent.\n\n3. Imperialism: European powers were competing for colonies and territories in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. This competition for resources and prestige often led to conflicts and heightened tensions among these powers.\n\n4. Nationalism: Ethnic groups in Europe aspired to have their own independent nations or expand their territories, leading to competition and tension among different countries in the region.\n\nThe event that triggered the start of World War I was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by a Serbian nationalist named Gavrilo Princip on June 28, 1914. Austria-Hungary accused Serbia of supporting the assassination plot and presented a harsh ultimatum. When Serbia failed to comply with all the demands, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on July 28, 1914. As a result of the interlocking alliances, the conflict quickly escalated, with Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, among others, entering the war. \n\nKey events leading to the start of World War I include:\n\n1. The formation of the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance: Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy formed the Triple Alliance in 1882. In response, France, Russia, and the United Kingdom formed the Triple Entente in 1907.\n\n2. The Bosnian Crisis (1908-1909): Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia angered Serbia and Russia, increasing tensions in the Balkan region.\n\n3. The First and Second Balkan Wars (1912-1913): A series of conflicts in the Balkans increased instability in the region and contributed to the hostilities leading up to World War I.\n\n4. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand: The assassination, as mentioned earlier, directly triggered the events leading to World War I.\n\nWorld War I had a profound impact on the world, causing significant political, social, and economic changes:\n\n1. Over 16 million people, including civilians, died as a direct result of World War I, with countless others suffering from physical and psychological injuries.\n\n2. The Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war, imposed severe financial reparations and territorial losses on Germany and Austria. These punitive measures contributed to economic hardships and social unrest, eventually paving the way for World War II.\n\n3. The war led to the downfall of four major empires: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Ottoman Empires. Several new nations emerged in their wake, as international boundaries were redrawn.\n\n4. The war contributed to the rise of the United States and Japan as global powers. The former became a major player in world affairs due to its economic and military strength, while the latter saw rapid industrialization and expansionist policies in Asia.\n\n5. World War I also marked the beginning of a broader cultural shift away from the idea of war as an honorable and glorious undertaking.

{"question_id": 635, "text": "Write an interview between a Female Film director and a journalist. Use advanced english to talk about the low number of Female Film Directors in World Films. Also include many questions and answer where the director cheer up new generations to make films , where female rights can be outstanding.", "task": "Koala", "answer": "Journalist (J): Thank you for joining me today. I'm honored to be in conversation with acclaimed Female Film Director, Ms. Jane Austen. Your work has been an inspiration to countless aspiring filmmakers and has notably shed light on the importance of female representation behind the camera. I would like to start by asking, what initially sparked your interest in the world of film directing, and how did you overcome any challenges you faced as a woman in a predominantly male-led industry?\n\nFemale Film Director (FFD): Thank you for having me. My interest in film directing began during my early film studies when I realized that the stories on screen were primarily male-centric, missing the nuances of female experiences. I was determined to change that by using the power of film as a medium to depict authentic female narratives. Overcoming the challenges I faced as a woman in the industry has certainly not been easy, but my passion for creating powerful stories with strong, richly complex female characters kept me driven and persistent.\n\nJ: The lack of gender parity among film directors has been an ongoing issue for decades, with few women being nominated or awarded in this category. How do you think the industry can address this disparity?\n\nFFD: The key is to create opportunities for women at every level of the filmmaking process, from screenplay development to post-production. By ensuring that female filmmakers are given equal opportunities to showcase their talent, we can slowly but surely dismantle the patriarchy that pervades the industry. It also requires a change in attitude: recognizing and celebrating female filmmakers for their artistic vision, rather than merely their gender.\n\nJ: In recent years, we have seen better representation on screen with complex and empowering female roles. However, the number of women directing films still remains astonishingly low. Why do you think the progress has been so slow for increasing the number of female film directors, and what are some actionable steps to encourage young women to pursue this career?\n\nFFD: The slow progress can be attributed to systemic barriers that restrict women's access to resources, opportunities, and networks within the industry. While tremendous strides have been made concerning on-screen representation, behind-the-camera roles remain mostly male-dominated. To encourage young women, it is crucial to amplify the successes of female filmmakers, providing mentorship opportunities and fostering a strong sense of community and support.\n\nJ: For the new generation of aspiring female filmmakers, what advice can you give to help them break into the industry and succeed in their careers?\n\nFFD: To new generations of women looking to break into the world of film: be persistent, be fearless and most importantly, be authentic. Do not let anyone diminish your vision or passion. Stay true to your artistic voice, and surround yourself with like-minded individuals who can challenge and strengthen your creative pursuits. Believe in your ability to create change in the industry, and fight for your place in it.\n\nJ: As a trailblazer in the world of film, how do you think cinema, as a medium, can effectively advocate for female rights and outstanding achievements?\n\nFFD: Cinema has the profound ability to influence societal change through the power of storytelling.

To improve the instance segmentation AP metrics using human knowledge, follow these steps:\n\n1. Gather high-quality data: Collect a diverse and representative dataset with images containing the objects of interest. Ensure that the dataset includes various backgrounds, lighting conditions, viewpoints, and occlusions to help the model generalize better.\n\n2. Annotate precisely: Use precise, high-quality annotations, including object bounding boxes and segmentation masks. Make sure that the annotations are accurate, as errors can negatively impact the model's performance.\n\n3. Train-test split: Split your dataset into separate training, validation, and testing sets to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.\n\n4. Use appropriate algorithms: Select or combine appropriate segmentation algorithms, such as Mask R-CNN, PANet, or YOLACT, based on your specific problem and dataset.\n\n5. Preprocessing: Apply data preprocessing methods like normalization, resizing, augmentation, and data balancing to prepare your dataset for training.\n\n6. Data Augmentation: Enhance the dataset's diversity and reduce overfitting by applying data augmentation techniques like horizontal flipping, rotation, zooming, and adding random noise.\n\n7. Transfer learning: Utilize pre-trained models to speed up the training process and improve segmentation performance. You can fine-tune these pre-trained models on your data, allowing them to leverage existing features and adapt to the specific problem.\n\n8. Hyperparameter tuning: Adjust the model's hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and optimizer to refine performance and avoid overfitting.\n\n9. Regularization techniques: Implement regularization techniques like dropout, L1, L2, or early stopping to prevent overfitting during training.\n\n10. Ensemble models: Combine multiple models or methods to improve overall performance by taking advantage of their complementary strengths.\n\n11. Human-in-the-loop: Utilize human expertise to validate and correct model predictions during the training or evaluation process. This can help to improve model performance and generalization to new situations.\n\n12. Performance evaluation and monitoring: Regularly review your model's performance on the validation set using AP metrics and other relevant performance indicators. This will identify areas for improvement and ensure that the model is not overfitting or underfitting.\n\n13. Iterate: Continuously iterate and improve on your model and dataset using insights gained from performance evaluations and human feedback.

In the case of the book, giving a mouse a cookie leads to the mouse asking for various other things, which ultimately turns into a continuous cycle.\n\nThe main reason it is considered a bad idea to give a mouse a cookie is that it serves as a metaphor for the potential pitfalls of indulging in initial, seemingly harmless requests.

Armed with my camera, I have become captivated with the power and allure of freezing memories in time, appreciating the nuanced narratives unfolding at every second, and immortalizing stories that have the potential to inspire others. As I submit this award application, I invite you on my journey as a photographer and how it has indelibly shaped my perspective, devotion to inspiring others, and passion for capturing life's most profound glimpses of emotion and beauty.\n\nA Profound Sense of Connection:\nMy passion for photography took roots when I dabbled in nature and landscape photography, intrigued by the breathtaking scenes of our world. Through my lens, I became keenly aware of the interconnectedness of all life forms with their surroundings. Witnessing the sun as it slowly descended behind a majestic mountain range, a flock of birds soaring in perfect harmony, or simply the intricate details of a dewdrop resting on a leaf deepened my appreciation for the delicate balance of our ecosystem. This ignited a desire in me to protect and preserve our planet through capturing and sharing these fragile moments of beauty with others.\n\nNurturing Empathy and Understanding:\nPhotography has also served to foster empathy and understanding within me, teaching me to see the world from different vantage points. As a portrait and street photographer, I have become intensely grounded in the vast array of emotions and experiences that define and connect the human family. Tender family embraces, the joyous triumph of an athlete crossing the finish line, or the sorrow etched on the face of a homeless man illuminated the universality of the human condition. These images have urged me to address the inequalities in our society and advocate for justice, unity, and compassion.\n\nInspiring Positive Change:\nMoreover, my photography became a conduit for inspiring positive change and highlighting critical issues. By shedding light on environmental crises, social injustices, and obscure heroes, I have used my art form as a catalyst for conversation and activism. By framing powerful images that make the viewer pause and ponder, I strive to evoke an emotional response, move them to take action, and use the visual stories as a testament to the resilience and strength of the human spirit.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, photography has inspired me by amplifying my ability to perceive and embrace the beauty, complexity, and interconnectedness of the world around us. It has played an instrumental role in honing my emotional intelligence, nurtured a sense of empathy and understanding, and enabled me to inspire positive change by immortalizing visual stories.

His instincts as a Jedi Knight told him that this was no coincidence, but rather a path laden with destiny.\n\nAs he ventured forth, the unrelenting jungle foliage and sweltering humidity did little to dampen his curiosity for this cryptic calling. Relentlessly, he hacked his way through the overgrown greenery, imagining the Jedi secrets that lay hidden just beyond.\n\nUpon reaching the edge of the clearing, Anakin was struck by the sight of a grand manor, seemingly out of place amongst the wild nature surrounding it. Hesitantly, he approached the ornate double doors adorned with golden etchings of the Jedi Order's symbol. He could sense the Force radiating from within.\n\nWithout making a sound, Anakin reached out, and the doors opened wide, revealing a great hall decorated in an opulent fashion that might put the wealthiest Naboo noble to shame. There before him stood a Jedi, dressed in tweed robes and finest silk cravats, effortlessly elegant despite the oppressive jungle atmosphere.\n\n\"Good heavens! Anakin Skywalker, is it not?\" the elder Jedi master exclaimed, sporting a pencil moustache that seemed to defy gravity. \"My goodness, what serendipity that the Force should lead you to us!\" His accent was undeniably from Coruscant's high society in the 1920s. Intrigued and slightly amused, Anakin couldn't help but want to find out more about this charismatic gentleman.\n\n\"Percival Algernon St. Clair-Davenport, at your service!\" the peculiar Jedi announced, extending a gloved hand to Anakin. \"Quite appropriate that a fellow Jedi of your calibre should breach the confines of this sanctuary.\"\n\nSquaring his shoulders and looking into Percival's expectant eyes, Anakin replied, \"Indeed! The Force has guided me here, Master St. Clair-Davenport, but for what purpose\u2026 I cannot say.\"\n\nPercival clapped his hands authoritatively. \"No matter the reason, old boy, your arrival pleases us. Allow me to introduce you to the members of our enclave. We are a collective few, trained in the ancient and esoteric arts of the Force that you may find quite... unconventional.\"\n\nAs Percival led Anakin through the resplendent halls of the manor, the young Jedi was introduced to a myriad of Jedi practitioners, many of whom displayed mannerisms, accents, and aesthetics reminiscent of the British aristocracy of the 1920s. Anakin pondered the juxtaposition of these characterful individuals with the ancient and mystical understanding of the Force.\n\nThroughout the day, Anakin was engrossed in the unique teachings of this enigmatic Jedi community. He discovered new connections to the Force, tapping into powers he had never before believed possible. The wisdom of these high society Jedi, coupled with their almost whimsical nature, made him wonder if the traditional Jedi methods he had been taught were too limiting.\n\nDuring a discussion over a sumptuous afternoon tea of scones and finger sandwiches, Anakin decided to raise the question that had been nagging him. \"What exactly led you all to adopt this... particular lifestyle?\"\n\nWith a warm, knowing smile, Percival replied, \"The galaxy is vast and filled with wonders, young Skywalker. Through embracing different cultural traits and experiences, we may all find a deeper connection to the Force, and indeed to each other.\"\n\nAnakin pondered this insight as he enjoyed a bite of cucumber sandwich, feeling the gentle tug of the Force as it drew him further into the mysteries of the universe.\n\nIn the end, Master Percival and his noble Jedi associates taught Anakin a valuable lesson: beneath the diversity of appearances, the binding energy of the Force connected them all.

{"question_id": 711, "text": "what are five important topics for game design", "task": "Koala", "answer": "1. Game mechanics: This is the foundation of game design, as game mechanics define the rules and systems that make a game playable and enjoyable. They encompass various aspects like game objectives, player actions and interactions, reward systems, and level progression. Effective game mechanics engage players, provide a sense of challenge, and keep them coming back for more.\n\n2. Storytelling and narrative: A compelling narrative can greatly enhance the player experience, especially in games that focus on story-driven gameplay. A well-crafted story helps players connect emotionally with the game, engages them with the characters, and offers a deeper immersion. It's essential to strike a balance between storytelling and gameplay so that both aspects enhance each other.\n\n3. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX): A well-designed UI/UX is crucial for making the game accessible, intuitive, and enjoyable for players. UI includes components like menus, on-screen prompts, and HUD, while UX refers to the overall experience a player has while interacting with the game. Understanding the player's perspective and improving usability is key to designing an engaging game experience.\n\n4. Art and aesthetics: Visuals play a crucial role in setting the tone, atmosphere, and style of the game. Graphics, colors, textures, character models, and environmental design work together to create a unified and visually appealing game world. To make a game stand out, designers often experiment with various art styles, keeping in mind the target audience and platform constraints.\n\n5. Playtesting and balancing: Testing is an indispensable part of game design that ensures the game is engaging, challenging, and fun. Regular playtesting helps identify gameplay issues, bugs, or inconsistencies that may otherwise go unnoticed. Balancing the game mechanics, difficulty levels, and character progression systems is essential for maintaining a sense of challenge and fairness, which ultimately contributes to the overall enjoyment of the game.", "domain_review": "Culture", "domain_labeled": ["Culture"], "total_tokens_step2": 469, "metric_explanation": "3, 12, 5\n\n3: The response should provide a comprehensive explanation of the five important topics in game design, covering each topic in detail to convey the significance and role of each in the design process.\n12: The response should directly address the instruction by listing and providing relevant information about the five important topics for game design, comprehensively fulfilling the requirements of the instruction.\n5: The response should be well-structured, with each of the five topics presented clearly and coherently, making the information easily digestible for the reader.\n\n[3, 12, 5]", "num_skills": 3, "metrics": ["Completeness", "Comprehension", "Readability"], "total_tokens": 1079, "difficulty_review": "Major level knowledge", "difficulty_labeled": "major level knowledge"}

Presale contracts are specifically designed for private sales and early investors before the token is launched publicly on a launchpad or a decentralized exchange.\n\nHere's a general overview of the process for your Defi project:\n\n1. Develop your main token contract: This is the core smart contract that defines and governs your token. It should be based on widely-accepted standards such as ERC-20 or ERC-721, which specify methods for transferring tokens and approving them for use in different applications.\n\n2. Create a presale contract: This separate contract is linked to your main token contract and holds tokens reserved for presale investors. The presale contract should include functionality to accept contributions from investors, allocate and distribute tokens, and transfer tokens back to the main contract once the presale is complete. Make sure to implement safeguards to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of the funds.\n\n3. Preparing for the private sale: Before launching your presale, be sure to thoroughly test and audit both the main and presale contracts. Gather a group of early investors, who might be strategic partners, friends, family, or institutional investors, and provide them with clear instructions on how to participate in the presale.\n\n4. Conduct the private sale: Upon launching the presale contract, investors can send their contributions (typically in ETH or another cryptocurrency) to the contract, which will then distribute the corresponding tokens to their wallets.\n\n5. Complete the presale and launch the token: After the private sale concludes and all tokens are distributed to early investors, you can officially launch your token by adding it to a launchpad or decentralized exchange.

{"question_id": 729, "text": "what is the recommended pattern for creating games in godot", "task": "Koala", "answer": "In Godot, there is a recommended pattern for creating games called \"Scene-Script Separation\" or \"Scene-Node structure.\" This pattern allows you to keep your game's logic and presentation layers separate, making it easier to maintain, extend, and reuse your code.\n\nHere are the main components of this pattern:\n\n1. Divide your game into Scenes: Break down your game into small, self-contained parts called Scenes. Each Scene usually represents a game object like a player, enemy, item, level, or menu. These can be created and saved as individual scene files (.tscn) in Godot.\n\n2. Use Nodes to compose Scenes: A Scene is made up of Nodes (the building blocks in Godot). Nodes can be organized in a hierarchical tree structure, where each node can have one parent and multiple children. You can also create custom node types by inheriting built-in nodes and extending their functionality.\n\n3. Attach Scripts to Nodes: Write your game logic using scripts (usually in GDScript, though C# and other languages are also supported). Each script should be attached to a relevant node in the scene, encapsulating the functionality of the specific object. This allows your code to be modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.\n\n4. Use Signals and Groups for communication: To establish communication between nodes and scenes, use Signals and Groups. Signals allow nodes to emit events when specific actions occur, and other nodes can connect to those signals to react to those events. Groups allow you to categorize nodes and perform actions on all nodes within a group, which is useful for game logic or managing related game objects.\n\n5. Use Scene instance and inheritance: Make use of scene instancing to create multiple instances of a scene for use within other scenes. This allows you to reuse scenes like prefabs. Additionally, you can inherit one scene from another to create variations or build upon an existing scene's structure and functionality.\n\n6. Optimize your game using child nodes and visibility: Optimize your game by managing child node visibility and enabled status. Hiding and disabling nodes when they are not needed can help improve performance.\n\nRemember that this is just one recommended pattern, and depending on your specific game and requirements, you may need to adapt or use different approaches. However, for many projects, following these guidelines should help you create an organized, maintainable, and flexible game structure in Godot.", "domain_review": "Technology, Culture", "domain_labeled": ["Technology", "Culture"], "total_tokens_step2": 472, "metric_explanation": "3, 7, 8\n\n3: The model should provide accurate background knowledge on Godot and the recommended pattern for creating games, ensuring that the information given is reliable and factual.\n7: The response should comprehensively explain the recommended pattern, covering all necessary components, and detailing each component sufficiently. \n8: The instruction has multiple requirements, so the response should address each component of the recommended pattern while fulfilling the overall purpose of the instruction by providing relevant information.\n\n[3, 7, 8]", "num_skills": 3, "metrics": ["Factuality", "Completeness", "Comprehension"], "total_tokens": 1174, "difficulty_review": "Major level knowledge", "difficulty_labeled": "major level knowledge"}

{"question_id": 784, "text": "Findings from Jumping Monkey Hill (Story #1)\nPlease respond to the following questions/prompts below. Be thoughtful, thorough, and specific.\n\nWhat were THREE motifs that were found to be present in this story? Please state the motif, cite the specific passage that you marked in support of said motif, and provide an explanation for how the evidence fits.\n\nIf you were to choose a key concept or two that you felt were present in this story, what were they, and why?\n\nFor example: American Dream/Disillusionment motif: \"You thought everybody in America had a car and a gun; your uncles and aunts and cousins thought so, too. Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.", "task": "Koala", "answer": "1. Identity and Belonging Motif: \"Something about the story, she thought, about the way it was written, made a reader feel that Ujunwa had not just written about a middle-aged woman who had worked as a principal and lived in southern Nigeria all her life. It was a story that had reached and pulled in so many other universals about being human\" (Adichie 126). Explanation: This passage supports the motif of identity and belonging because the protagonist, Ujunwa, writes a story that transcends a specific background, which resonates with readers from various cultural backgrounds. By doing so, Ujunwa highlights the shared human experiences that connect us all despite our different identities and origins.\n\n2. Power and Exploitation Motif: \"'You are in my house. In my bedroom. Did you think that I brought you here to know what you think about the stories?' Edward's voice was high, like a woman's. He laughed. 'You are here as a favor to me, my dear. You have to be nice to me'\" (Adichie 131). Explanation: This passage illustrates the power and exploitation motif as Edward uses his influence as a workshop director to manipulate Ujunwa into being submissive. He takes advantage of her vulnerability and her passion for writing, forcing her into a compromising situation. This power imbalance is a recurring theme in the story and reflects the broader societal issue of exploitation.\n\n3. Feminism and Gender Inequality Motif: \"He did not think men were foolish, of course. He simply chose to write about them that way. Like all clever people, he knew that one could not offend the powers-that-be, that one could not challenge an entire culture's view of masculinities\" (Adichie 129). Explanation: The passage supports the motif of feminism and gender inequality by highlighting how society's expectations of masculinity constrain people's expression and creativity. The protagonist recognizes that although men cannot be directly critiqued due to societal norms, portraying them as foolish is a subtle form of rebellion against these expectations. This passage also provides insight into how entrenched gender roles limit both women and men.\n\nKey Concept 1: Empowerment - Throughout the story, Ujunwa struggles to find her voice and assert her identity as a writer. Taking a stand against Edward's exploitation and writing a story that connects with universal human experiences demonstrates her empowerment. The story showcases the importance of finding one's voice and using it to make a difference.\n\nKey Concept 2: Resilience - Ujunwa's ability to confront her challenges head-on and refuse to stay silent in the face of adversity demonstrates resilience. Despite Edward's actions and societal expectations, Ujunwa emerges as a strong and confident writer who remains true to her identity. The story encourages readers to persevere despite obstacles and remain true to their beliefs.", "domain_review": "Culture", "domain_labeled": ["Culture"], "total_tokens_step2": 719, "metric_explanation": "5, 6, 1\n\n5: Responding to this instruction requires providing relevant information that fulfills the various requirements and specific prompts, ensuring that each question is addressed thoroughly.\n\n6: When discussing the motifs, citations, and concepts, it's crucial to provide comprehensive and detailed explanations, ensuring the depth of understanding is effectively communicated.\n\n1: Accurate background knowledge and factual information from the story is necessary to support the analysis and discussion of motifs, citations, and key concepts.\n\n\\n\n[5, 6, 1]", "num_skills": 3, "metrics": ["Comprehension", "Completeness", "Factuality"], "total_tokens": 1523, "difficulty_review": "Major level knowledge", "difficulty_labeled": "major level knowledge"}

In a more definitive approach, courts presume harm from speech in cases involving discrimination or sexual harassment. While the original justification for these obscenity laws was predicated on an unfounded assumption that speech can deprave or corrupt children, and it is important to note that there is little (if any) social science data demonstrating that a word is by itself harmful, it is also pertinent to consider the origin of some derogatory words and the context of their usage to understand why they should be unacceptable in social settings. Examples include:\\n-Ape/Monkey: These are considered offensive terms when used to describe a person of color because offensive comparisons of black people to apes date back hundreds of centuries, such as when scientists Josiah C. Nott and George R. Gliddon created the 1854 Types of Mankind (a leading scientific text on race in its time), and they compared black people not to other (white) people but to chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. They are now, justifiably, considered extremely derogatory slang.\\n-Savage: When used as an adjective to describe acts of violence, this word is not considered offensive, but the use of 'savage' as a noun to describe people dates back to a time when Christopher Columbus was enslaving Native Americans and claiming their lands and work for his own. The word became a slur used by white Europeans to describe Native American people.

It stars Ansel Elgort as a young getaway driver, who finds catharsis in music, seeking freedom from a life of organized crime with his lover Debora (Lily James). Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, Jamie Foxx, and Jon Bernthal appear in supporting roles. Eric Fellner and his Working Title Films partner Tim Bevan produced \"Baby Driver\" alongside Big Talk Productions' Nira Park. Sony and TriStar Pictures co-financed and distributed the film. \"Baby Driver\" is a longtime passion project Wright had developed for over two decades. He devised the film's blueprint well into his youth, but the experience helming his other projects shaped his ambitions for \"Baby Driver\". Originally centered in Los Angeles, the film's setting was later revised to Atlanta in the script, and preserving its ethos became an important aspect of the storytelling. Principal photography took place in the city over four months, from February to May 2016. Production involved the planning of meticulously coordinated stunts, choreography, and shooting as much of the film in-camera as possible. \"Baby Driver\" premiered at South by Southwest on March 11, 2017, and in theaters in North America and the United Kingdom on June 28, 2017.", "task": "Finegrained-rlhf", "answer": "Baby Driver premiered at South by Southwest on March 11, 2017.

It is also centred on the separation of the wizarding world from the non-wizarding (Muggle) world. Despite being an inherent talent, magic is honed through study of various branches of magic and practical training into a skill. A great deal of effort is expended in keeping the Muggles unaware of magic. Originally the two worlds co-existed; however, persecution of those with magic meant magical laws have been put in place over the centuries, designed to keep the existence of the magical world hidden from Muggles. The first and most important statute is the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy of 1692. Enchantment of Muggle artefacts is forbidden; under-age wizards are restricted from using magic outside school, and any deliberate revelation of magical ability to the Muggle community is punishable. However, allowances are made for the use of magic in the presence of a Muggle in case of a life-threatening situation (for the wizard or the Muggle). | wikipage: J. K.

The book's last chapter was one of the earliest things she wrote in the entire series. \"Harry Potter\" is now a global brand worth an estimated US$15\u00a0billion, and the last four \"Harry Potter\" books have consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history. The series, totalling 4,195 pages, has been translated, in whole or in part, into 65 languages. The \"Harry Potter\" books have also gained recognition for sparking an interest in reading among the young at a time when children were thought to be abandoning books for computers and television, although it is reported that despite the huge uptake of the books, adolescent reading has continued to decline. In October 1998, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to the first two novels for a seven-figure sum. A film adaptation of \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" was released on 16 November 2001, and \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" on 15 November 2002.

Amy is a companion of the series protagonist the Doctor, in his eleventh incarnation, played by Matt Smith. She appears in the programme from the fifth series (2010) to midway through the seventh series (2012). The Doctor first meets Amelia when she is seven years old (portrayed by Caitlin Blackwood) and disturbed by a crack in her wall (that is actually one of several cracks in the universe). He promises to return to the lonely girl in five minutes and take her with him in the TARDIS (his time and space machine), but accidentally arrives twelve years later, by which time adult Amy has become sceptical about her \"imaginary friend\". However, she eventually decides to travel with him, and the duo are later joined by her fianc\u00e9 Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill). Amy and Rory marry at the end of the fifth series. In the sixth series, Amy gives birth to their daughter, Melody Pond, who is revealed to be recurring character (since the fourth series) River Song (Alex Kingston). | wikipage: The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who) text: Karen Gillan was cast as the Doctor's new companion Amy Pond; she had previously appeared in the fourth series episode \"The Fires of Pompeii\" and was suggested to Moffat by casting director Andy Pryor. Gillan auditioned for the role in both her natural Scottish and English accents. Only after Gillan was cast was Amy made Scottish. The young Amy, known as Amelia, was played by Karen Gillan's real-life cousin Caitlin Blackwood. Though Gillan recommended Blackwood, the young actor first had to undergo rigorous auditions, lacking any formal acting experience. \"The Eleventh Hour\" was also the debut of Arthur Darvill as Rory Williams, who became a regular in the sixth series. Moffat stated that what stood out about Darvill's audition was \"just how funny\" he was. \"EastEnders\" star Nina Wadia was chosen for the part of the doctor at the Leadworth Hospital. Wadia speculated that she was cast because she had worked with Adam Smith before. Patrick Moore appears as himself in the video conference with a brief speaking part, though not all his lines survived the final cut. The man above Moore is the brother of Adam Smith. Marcello Magni, who played a man Prisoner Zero impersonates that barks like his dog, had already worked as a canine impersonator. | wikipage: Doctor Who text: Doctor Who\\n\\nDoctor Who is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC since 1963. The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord called \"the Doctor\", an extraterrestrial being, to all appearances human, from the planet Gallifrey. The Doctor explores the universe in a time-travelling space ship called the TARDIS. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Accompanied by a number of companions, the Doctor combats a variety of foes while working to save civilisations and help people in need. The show is a significant part of British popular culture, and elsewhere it has gained a cult following. It has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot, in the form of a television film titled \"Doctor Who\".

There's a bakery near me that makes shockingly good and interesting danishes. They really shine in terms of textural contrast. They must use a really high protein bread flour because I've not found such distinct lamination elsewhere, and it's on the chewy end. They typically put some kind of custard or cheesecake in the center, and some fruit or marshmallow on top. But the most intriguing feature of these danishes is that they have some kind of glaze, which I think contributes to the crispiness on its own, but also must help preserve the natural crispiness of the dough, because they stay crispy for hours.  I've tried to replicate this glaze at home many many times but one constraining factor is I genuinely don't know what it is. I don't \\*think\\* they are merely blowtorching sugar onto the pastry because it's not burnt. I tried painting some melted sugar on with a pastry brush but that was a mess -- the sugar hardened in the air on the way to the danish, so I doubt that's what they're doing.  I'd imagine something like a simple syrup would achieve the opposite effect. I doubt it's a jam glaze (it's shiny and sweet, but it's not fruity).

A Texas Mr. Basketball in high school, he played one season of college basketball for Georgia Tech before declaring for the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors. While at Toronto, Bosh became a five-time NBA All-Star, was named to the All-NBA Second Team once, played for the U.S. national team (with whom he won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics), and supplanted former fan favorite Vince Carter as the face and leader of the Raptors franchise. In the 2006\u201307 season, Bosh led the Raptors to their first playoff appearance in five years and their first-ever division title. He left Toronto in 2010 as the franchise's all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks, and minutes played.In 2010, after seven seasons with the Raptors, Bosh entered into a sign-and-trade deal whereby he was traded to the Miami Heat. In Miami, he joined fellow stars Dwyane Wade and LeBron James; the trio became known as the Big Three. Bosh spent the second half of his career with Miami, appearing in the NBA Finals each year from 2011 to 2014 and winning NBA titles in 2012 and 2013. He made the NBA All-Star team every year during his time in Miami. Bosh's career was cut short by a blood clotting condition that the NBA ruled to be a career-ending illness. He played his final NBA game on February 9, 2016. Notwithstanding the NBA's ruling, Bosh fought to resume his playing career for three years before announcing in February 2019 that he intended to retire. The same year, the Heat retired his No. 1 jersey.

Ebsen didn't mind the swap, so Bolger and Ebsen swapped roles. While Ray was pleased with his role as the Scarecrow, the aluminum dust from Ebsen's Tin Man make-up nearly choked him to the edge of death (causing Ebsen to have to give up that role). Ebsen was replaced by Jack Haley for his role of the Tin Man. Bolger's costume consisted of a straw-stuffed suit and a light face mask of rubber designed to simulate burlap. The mask was fragile, and usually had to be completely replaced at the start of each new day of filming. Bolger's Scarecrow costume, minus the mask, is part of the collections of the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution. Bolger was a talented dancer, so The Scarecrow was given an extended dance sequence in the movie. However, to shorten the movie, much of this sequence was edited out since it would slow down the film. | wikipage: Scarecrow (Oz) text: This version of the Scarecrow was a more tragic character before Dorothy rescues him; while hung on his pole, the crows he is unable to scare, who force him to humiliate himself and entertain them, torment him day and night. They force him to sing the song, \"You Can't Win\", meaning that he cannot escape the crows' rule and his bad luck. While Stan Winston created Jackson's makeup, it was applied to Jackson's face by Michael R. Thomas who portrayed the Scarecrow in Barry Mahon's \"The Wonderful Land of Oz\" (1969), as well as doing the makeup for that film. Elijah Kelley portrayed the Scarecrow in the TV special \"The Wiz Live! \", as well as the farmhand Sticks. In the animated film \"Journey Back to Oz\" (produced in 1964 but not released until the 1970s), the Scarecrow was voiced by Mickey Rooney. In an episode of \"The World's Greatest Super Friends\", Aquaman temporarily became the Scarecrow after a tornado took him, Superman and Wonder Woman to Mister Mxyzptlk\u2019s planet of Oz. | wikipage: Scarecrow (Oz) text: In a 1981 episode of \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\", Shaggy is dressed as the Scarecrow after a tornado took him, Scooby, and Scrappy to \"Ahz\", a direct spoof of Oz with a different spelling by its enunciation. Justin Case, an English bicycle acrobat, appeared briefly as the Scarecrow in the 1985 film \"Return to Oz\". American voice actor Michael Gough voices the Scarecrow in 2011's direct-to-DVD animated film \"Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz\".

The theatre became an important cultural institution in Thailand, attracting both local and international audiences. Its performances are known for their unique synthesis of live puppetry, traditional Thai music, and classical dance.\n\nUnder Tappaya's direction, the Joe-Louis Puppet Theatre has emerged as a leading voice in the world of Thai puppetry, receiving numerous awards for its excellence in the field. In addition to his work with the theatre, Tappaya is also an accomplished teacher, sharing his vast knowledge of puppetry with students and younger generations of puppeteers.\n\nIn 2004, after the theatre's original location closed down, Tappaya was instrumental in the revival of the Joe-Louis Puppet Theatre at the Asiatique The Riverfront in Bangkok, where it continues to entertain audiences today.\n\nTappaya Sit-Or's dedication to preserving the art of traditional Thai puppetry is evident through his work at the Joe-Louis Theatre, ensuring that this unique and important aspect of Thai culture endures for future generations.", "domain_review": "Culture, History", "domain_labeled": ["Culture", "History"], "total_tokens_step2": 474, "metric_explanation": "1, 2, 3\n\nSkill 1: To accurately provide the biography of Tappaya Sit-Or, the response must be factually correct and logically coherent.\nSkill 2: The response should cover relevant information about Tappaya Sit-Or's life, career, and contributions, fulfilling the requirements of the biographical instruction.\nSkill 3: Factual knowledge must be retrieved accurately without misinformation, ensuring the reliability of the background information included in the biography.\n\n[1, 2, 3]", "num_skills": 3, "metrics": ["Logical Correctness", "Comprehension", "Factuality"], "total_tokens": 1028, "difficulty_review": "Expert level knowledge", "difficulty_labeled": "expert level knowledge"}

{"question_id": 1659, "text": "Turkeys have excellent hearing. On the first Tuesday of October, when the five-bird flock was out pecking around in the yard behind Farmer MacDougall\u2019s home, they overheard the chilling words that would drive one of them to attempted man-slaughter. Farmer MacDougall and a stranger were standing in front of the open kitchen window of the house, looking out at the turkeys. \u201cWe\u2019re only asking for one,\u201d the stranger said. \u201cSurely, you can spare one for the Thanksgiving dinner down at the Mission this year, Farmer MacDougall. It would help feed a number of disadvantaged families.\u201d At the mere mention of the word \u2018Thanksgiving\u2019, the big birds in the yard froze. Beaker and Beau stopped gobbling at one another. Red stopped her clipped beak in mid-preen. The newest addition to the flock, a Canadian bird named Leaf, who\u2019d kept to himself for the week he\u2019d been on the farm so far, cocked a beady eye at the window. While Old Leatherneck, twelve years-young and counting, was instantly jolted awake, his blue and red wattles flying as he jerked his head upwards. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Farmer MacDougall said, scratching the stubble on his chin. \u201cI\u2019m mighty attached to all of my birds. I\u2019ve never really considered them food, except for the eggs, of course. Why, I just don\u2019t-\u201d \u201cFarmer MacDougall, please!\u201d the stranger interrupted. \u201cWe know we\u2019re going to be short of turkeys this year \u2013 what with the Poultry Mill shutting down. And with the economic recession, monetary donations are way down with which to buy turkeys. We\u2019re only asking you for one!\u201d The five turkeys stared up at Farmer MacDougall, as he looked down at them. He rubbed his jaw, in behind his ear. Normally, he would give some money to the Mission himself. But times were tough. \u201cWeeelll, ookaay, you can have one bird \u2026 I guess.\u201d Red fell over in a dead faint, while Beau and Beaker\u2019s tail feathers fanned up in alarm. * \u201cYou all know why we\u2019re here,\u201d Beau stated a day later, looking around at the other four turkeys gathered in the barn. A heavy frost had crusted the ground that morning, fall and fall suppers truly in the air now. \u201cWhy?\u201d Red asked. Even for a turkey, she was a particularly dumb cluck. \u201cBecause we all live here, that\u2019s why,\u201d Beaker said impatiently. \u201cWhere else are we going to be?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Beau retorted, shaking his snood in frustration. \u201cBecause Farmer MacDougall is going to kill one of us for the Mission\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner. Our necks are on the line!\u201d \u201cNot mine,\u201d Old Leatherneck crowed. \u201cI\u2019m too old and stringy, wouldn\u2019t make much of a meal.\u201d \u201cWell, as a hen, I\u2019m only half as heavy as you toms,\u201d Red said, primping her feathers, \u201cso I wouldn\u2019t feed many \u2013 would I?\u201d \u201cWe have to stop Farmer MacDougall,\u201d Beau intoned meaningfully, his eyes darting from one bird to the other, way over to Leaf off by himself in a corner of the barn. \u201cWe have to get him before he gets one of us.\u201d There was a general ruckus of yelping and whistling at that pronouncement. The turkeys liked Farmer MacDougall and the way he treated them \u2013 lots of mash and grains to eat, plenty of water, straw-lined nooks to roost in and a free range to stretch their legs. But now, with their lives at stake, they realized they had to flock together. \u201cWhat exactly are you suggesting?\u201d Old Leatherneck queried. \u201cWait a minute!\u201d Beaker exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ve got it! I can write to the President and ask for a pardon. He does that, you know, for certain birds.\u201d Beau scoffed. \u201cYou can\u2019t write.\u201d \u201cNo, but I can peck out a letter on Farmer MacDougall\u2019s computer.\u201d \u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Old Leatherneck stated sourly. \u201cI think what Beau is saying is that Farmer MacDougall has to have an accident,\u201d Leaf suddenly spoke up from across the barn, the first time he had said anything to the other birds. \u201cRight, Beau?\u201d \u201cExactly,\u201d the big bird beaked. The turkeys looked at one another, their walnut-sized brains working. * It was a cold, foggy morning the second Tuesday in October, when Farmer MacDougall walked out of his house and across the yard to the barn, intent on milking Brown Betty the cow. His eyes were bleary after another sleepless night \u2013 the recent turkey promise he\u2019d made to the Mission man was weighing heavily on his mind \u2013 and so, as he pulled the barn door open, he failed to notice the rake lying half-buried in the straw just inside the door. He stepped into the barn, onto the steel-pronged end of the leaf and grass-gathering tool. The long, heavy wooden handle of the rake shot upwards and struck him square in the forehead. He dropped like a sack of turkey feed and lay still in the straw. * The five turkeys filed out of their pen at the rear of the barn when Farmer MacDougall was late with their breakfast. They found the old sod-tiller, flat on his back. \u201cGood gravy!\u201d Red yelped. \u201cFarmer MacDougall\u2019s had an accident!\u201d Old Leatherneck stepped forward and examined the rake lying across Farmer MacDougall\u2019s chest, poked around in the straw and came up with a tail feather. \u201cWas no \u2018accident\u2019,\u201d the old bird concluded. \u201cWe turkeys have powerful legs and long, strong toes, just right for dragging a rake into the proper position. Looks to me like someone tried to get Farmer MacDougall to buy the farm, like we all talked about last week.\u201d He stroked his beard with a wing, gazing at the assembled turkeys, Leaf by himself off to the side. \u201cAnd I think I can guess who the dirty bird is,\u201d he added. Just as Farmer MacDougall raised his head and gave it a shake. The man groaned, feeling like he\u2019d just had the stuffing knocked out of him. Which turkey is responsible?", "task": "Bigbench: minute mysteries qa", "answer": "Old Longneck explained, \u201cRed wouldn\u2019t have attempted the man-slaughter, as she knew that she wouldn\u2019t likely be chosen as the guest of honor at the Mission dinner table, being only half the size of the male birds. Beaker wouldn\u2019t have gone to such extremes, either \u2013 at least, not until he received a reply to his plea for a Presidential pardon. If Leaf had wanted to stop Farmer MacDougall from sacrificing one of the flock for Thanksgiving, he would have struck earlier.
